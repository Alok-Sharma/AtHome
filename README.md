# AtHome
Find out who is home. Android app for the HCI course project.

###Branch: Mile1:
This branch uses the second 'algorithm' for determining friends/roommates.
This is the implicit friend list, i.e. determines which friends status to fetch based on the router MAC address associated with each
user. So instead of having a dynamic list of friends, it just checks who is registered with this app, and is on the same router.
