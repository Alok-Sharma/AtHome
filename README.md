# AtHome
Find out who is home. Android app for the HCI course project.

###Master Branch
 Currently this branch uses an explicit friend-list 'algorithm' to determine who are the roommates, and fetch their at home status.
 This means that they should be allowed to add friends, remove friends, approve of someone else adding them etc. The UI at this branch
 does not provide for any of that.
